<p>Raxan is a framework that is designed to accelerate PHP/Ajax web development by making it easier for developers to build and deploy
rich web applications.</p>

<p><img src="images/api-stack.png" align="right" alt="Raxan" class="margin" /></p>

<p>Over the years programmers having relied on open source technology to help them build and deliver quality solutions for their customers.
Today, developers have the choice to choose a technology that best suit their needs. This is all made possible because others have so generously
contributed to the open source community.</p>

<p>Raxan provides developers with yet another choice. It provides a set of integrated technology that's open source and readily available for
both personal and commercial use.</p>

<p>Raxan is designed in such a way that it can either be used independent of or integrated with existing
frameworks so that you can make the best use of your existing technology and investments. With Raxan, we are simply adding another player to the
framework space which will lead to more choice and flexibility for developers.</p>

<p>The technology used behind Raxan is licensed under the open sourced MIT and GPL licenses and is based on today's web standards.
This means that you have the option to modify or change the behavior of Raxan to suit your own needs.</p>

<p>By using a set of design patterns we were able to build a framework that's modular, extensible and easy to use.  This modular structure provides
developers with a consistent interface for building and distributing reusable components.</p>
