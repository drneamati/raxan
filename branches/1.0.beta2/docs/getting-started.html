<p>The aim of this framework is to make it easy for web developers to create unobtrusive, beautiful and accessible web sites and applications that work across multiple browsers.</p>

<p>Before we go any further, let me quickly point out that Raxan is not for everyone. Some developers prefer the Do-It-From-Scratch or the Build-It-Yourself approach and might not find Raxan to be a suitable fit for their environment. If you're willing to open your mind to new ideas and development then read on.</p>

<h3>Download and Install</h3>

<p>The get started download and install the latest version from the Raxan PDI website. See <a href="installation.html">Downloading and Installation Instructions</a></p>

<h3>Understanding the Framework</h3>

<p>Raxan was designed to be as flexible as possible, giving developers the power to choose the JavaScript libraries and/or frameworks they would like to use. Raxan in its simplest form can be used as a stand-alone dynamic JavaScript/CSS loader, however, the framework is bundled with a CSS framework, jQuery libraries and APIs that are readily available to all developers, as an option when developing Rich Ajax/HTML Applications. When working with PHP and the PDI classes the framework will use the jQuery libraries for internal PHP/Ajax communications.</p>

<p>The bundled jQuery libraries include, the latest stable jQuery Core (jquery), UI Effects (jquery-ui-effects) and UI Interactions (jquery-ui-interactions). Developers can use their own customized version of the jQuery library by adding it to the plugins folder.</p>

<h3>Reading the User Guide</h3>

<p>You're next step to start reading the Introduction and General Topics to become familiar with the framework.</p>

<h3>Choosing a good PHP Editor</h3>

<p>While it is true that you can use just about any text editor to create Raxan PDI applications, I would recommend that you go the way of using an IDE to increase productivity. There are many Open Source and commercial PHP IDEs available for you to choose from but my personal favorite is the open source <a href="http://www.netbeans.org/features/php/">NetBeans PHP IDE</a>.</p>

<h3>Getting Help</h3>

<p>The Raxan Community is available to help you with any questions that you might have in regards to the framework. Please feel free to join the community and share you're your thoughts and ideas.</p>
